Third Party Suppliers
Our Third Party Suppliers, such as airlines, hotels, car rentals, and tour operators, are not employees or affiliate of WCA Travel but independent contractors. By posting their products and services in this Website, we are not endorsing nor affiliating them with us. Your interaction with our Third Party Suppliers through this Website is at your own risk, and WCA Travel will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any of our Third Party Suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with our Third Party Suppliers.

WCA Travel may have pre-negotiated a better rate with our Third Party Suppliers for your benefit. The rates indicated on this Website already include the total of the pre-negotiated rates and the service charge collected by WCA Travel.

In addition to your obligations under these Terms and Conditions, you are also bound by the rules and restrictions of our Third Party Suppliers such as, but not limited to, those found in the contract of carriage with airline companies, hotel terms and conditions, and credit card policies, as the case may be. Violation of these additional rules may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), denial of access to the applicable travel products or services, forfeiture of monies paid for such reservation, and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.

The circumvention of airline rules, including practices such as back-to-back ticketing (purchasing two or more tickets with overlapping travel dates in order to circumvent minimum stay requirements) and hidden-city ticketing (purchasing tickets including segments which the purchaser does not intend to use in order to circumvent an air carrier's pricing structure), is prohibited by several airlines. The use of prohibited ticketing practices may result in the cancellation of the ticket, denial of boarding, revocation of frequent flier miles and other benefits, additional charges to the purchaser's credit card, additional charges collected at the airport, or future invoicing. You are responsible for ensuring that the flight you booked using this Website do not violate any airline contract of carriage.

Some of our Third Party Suppliers require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service they offer. You are free to refuse to execute the liability waiver. However, such refusal shall result in you not being able to participate in the particular service where you agree not to execute a waiver.

We reserve the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion. Some Third Party Suppliers like hotels, car rentals or tour operators may require you to present a credit card or cash deposit intended to cover additional expenses. Such deposit is not connected with the payment made to WCA Travel at the time you made your booking.

You may also modify or cancel your travel booking, subject to the applicable fees charged and refund policies of our respective Third Party Supplier.

The taxes for services of Third Party Suppliers are remitted by them.
